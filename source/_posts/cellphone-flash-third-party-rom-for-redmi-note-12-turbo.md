The conclusion is that it is not recommended to flash a third-party ROM.

## Unlocking the Bootloader

Before flashing a third-party ROM, you need to unlock your phone's bootloader.

1. Navigate to 【Settings】 -> 【My device】 -> 【Detailed info and specs】. Tap 【MIUI version】 ten times to enable 【developer mode】.

2. Navigate to 【Settings】 - 【Additional settings】 - 【Developer options】 - 【MI unlock status】. Bind your XiaoMi account to device.

   After bind your XiaoMi account to device, you will receive a notification that you can unlock your bootloader after 7 days(168hours).

   Avoid tapping it repeatedly, as it resets the countdown, requiring another 168 hours of waiting.

3. Download [miflash_unlock_7.6.727.43.zip](https://cdn.cnbj1.fds.api.mi-img.com/flash-tool/miflash_unlock_7.6.727.43.zip) from the [official XiaoMi unlock site](https://www.miui.com/unlock/index.html). Unzip the file, and log in with your XiaoMi account. (Note: Some computers might require driver installation if prompted).

4. Power off you phone, then press 【power】 + 【volume -】 to enter fastboot mode. Connect your phone to your computer via USB cable. Click 【unlock】 in the miflash_unlock software. Keep in mind that this operation will erase your data, so make a backup if you needed.

## Flashing the ROM

1. Download an official ROM suitable for your phone from [xiaomirom.com](https://xiaomirom.com/) or a third-party ROM like EU from [xiaomi.eu](https://xiaomi.eu/community/). Unzip the downloaded file.

2. Download [MiFlash2020-3-14-0.rar](https://cdn.alsgp0.fds.api.mi-img.com/micomm/MiFlash2020-3-14-0.rar) for the official ROM. Unzip it, and install the necessary drivers if prompted. Enter fastboot mode on your phone and connect it to your computer.

3. In MiFlash, select the ROM directory, then click 【refresh】. You will see your device ID. Note: If your ROM's region differs from where you bought your phone, choose 【delete all】 instead of 【delete all and lock】from the option in the lower right corner. Relocking the bootloader with a wrong region ROM will get you stuck at the boot screen. Finally flash the ROM by clicking 【flash】. Your phone will reboot once the process is complete.

   Without selecting 【delete all and lock】 you will get an error: `error:Not catch checkpoint (\$fastboot -s .*lock), flash is not done`. However, this is acceptable, and the flashing process is successful.

The nature of MiFlash involves running batch executable files. Therefore, if you are using a third-party ROM, excuting the batch file in your ROM will suffice.

## User Experience

The official XiaoMi European ROM (EEA_14.0.9.0 for Redmi Note 12 Turbo) is hard to use. Switching apps from background to foreground often results in unresponsive touch operations. Additionally, there are numerous pre-installed useless apps that can't uninstall. And the 【Update system apps】 function does't work at all, displaying a "No Internet Connection" message.

The third-party ROM (EU_14.0.25.0 for Redmi Note 12 Turbo) derived from the Chinese version, offers several advantages. There are no advertisements or anti-fraud modules, and it includes all Google frameworks. Some pre-installed apps can be uninstalled or disabled, and the rest can be removed using [adbshell](https://adbshell.com/). However the official OTA updates are not valid, and you can't download Chinese apps with Google Play. To update to a new ROM version, TWRP must be installed first. Then flashing the new version through the Recovery system partition. Alternatively, you can reboot to fastboot mode for an update without clearing data. I choose HuaWei AppGallery to manage Chinese apps, although it can't update apps in the background as it's not the system default app market.

In summary, if you can overlook potential pravicy concerns, pervasive advertisements, and integrated anti-fraud modules, the Chinese version of the ROM offers the most convenience and usability.
